# JSkyCalc
Interactive Java time and the sky code.  

At present, this only contains an executable .jar file that should run on most systems.  On a 'nix system:

java -jar JSkyCalc.jar

The source is not included; message me if you would like it.  Also, the help text does not work correctly, but it should not be needed by most users.

I'm posting this in a bit of a hurry because apparently the Dartmouth link to this code broke.  This should be more widely accessible.
